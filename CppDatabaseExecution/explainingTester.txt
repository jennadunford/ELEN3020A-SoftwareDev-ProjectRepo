Prerequisites for tester.cpp to work:

This deb package: (libmysqlcppconn9_8.0.29-1ubuntu20.04_amd64.deb)
sudo apt install libmysqlcppconn-dev library

The command to compile it so that it works:  sudo g++ -Wall -I/usr/include/cppconn -o testapp tester.cpp -L/usr/lib -lmysqlcppconn

and then:
./testapp to run the executable

We still need to figure out how to get this to happen automatically
