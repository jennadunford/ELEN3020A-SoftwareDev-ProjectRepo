****ABOUT PROTOTYPE APPLICATION J1****

This contains a netbeans project containing:
- Basic UI for the project created in QT Designer
- Basic C++ functions for the project
- Project is a QT C++ Application 
- Runs in netbeans 13 with most recent QT designer

You should be able to open the project in netbeans if you have QT Designer and netbeans installed properly
with the appropriate C/C++ plugins.

For now this will be worked on to try and get a basic prototype working in C, will possibly try and
translate the code into python at a later stage

Right now the prototype only accepts user inputs and outputs the selected inputs.

Need to check database compatability with project.
